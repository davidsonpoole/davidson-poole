This is my portfolio website, but it needs to be updated and formatted. It was my first introduction to Javascript (specifically React), so it is very bare-bones and I never quite got the CSS formatting working like I wanted it. It was online for a bit- I had given it a domain name and was hosting it on AWS, but then I took it down to save money. This is a project I always say I will go back to and update... but it hasn't gotten done yet.

This project made me realize that:
- Javascript is an interesting language, unlike any other
- There's a lot more to a website than meets the eye
- CSS is the worst

**Run the App**
1. Clone the project into your directory of choice `git clone https://github.com/davidsonpoole/davidson-poole.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies `npm i`
3. Run the development version of the app `npm run dev`
4. Notice it functions like a bare-bones website should, never mind the styling
