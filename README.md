This is my portfolio website, but it needs to be updated and formatted. It was my first introduction to Javascript (specifically React), so it is very bare-bones and I never quite got the CSS formatting working like I wanted it. This is a project I always say I will go back to and update but it hasn't gotten done yet.

This project made me realize that:
- Javascript is an interesting language, unlike any other
- There's a lot more to a website than meets the eye
- CSS is the worst
